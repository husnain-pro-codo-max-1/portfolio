                  <p>In recent projects, I've showcased my web development proficiency and tech-savvy approach. "bazar.com" stands out, an E-commerce site powered by React.js, Firebase, and Redux. It underscores my mastery of front-end tech and cloud integration. Then, my personal portfolio, built with React.js and Bootstrap, reflects my design flair and responsive web skills. Lastly, "watspi," a private project, demanded a robust tech stack: React.js, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB. It's a testament to my backend and database expertise. These projects collectively highlight my adaptability, technical prowess, and commitment to top-notch web solutions.</p>
